# Brain Buster by DinoJerks

An application by [Charlie Whitney](http://sharkbox.com) and [Benjamin Bokjo](http://benjaminbojko.com) for #hackthedinos at the AMNH on 11/22/2015 to solve the [Build A Brain challenge](https://github.com/amnh/HacktheDinos/wiki/Build-A-Brain).

It takes in CT scan slices and outputs a mesh cloud based on a selected bone density.

This compiles to an executable application for OSX 10.8 and up.
